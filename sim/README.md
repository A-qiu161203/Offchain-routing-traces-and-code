# Flash

Flash is a dynamic routing solution for offchain networks. It compares with a set of state-of-the-art routing algorithms and comes with the traces of real offchain networks for evaluating the performance. 

## Traces 

### Topology
* Ripple Network (1,870 nodes and 17,416 edges) 
* Lightning Network (2,511 nodes and 36,016 edges)

### Dataset
* 2.6 million transactions in Ripple (January 2013 to November 2016)
* 103 million transactions (January 2009 to October 2018)

## Getting Started 

### Source file structure
* Trace files are in [sim/traces](sim/traces) 
* Scheme sources are in [sim/routing](sim/routing)
* Scripts to process results are in [sim/result](sim/result)
